# Portfolio Project: Simple E-commerce with React & Node.js

This is a simple but complete e-commerce project built to demonstrate a modern full-stack application architecture. The goal is to showcase the integration between a React front-end and a Node.js back-end API.

## Key Features

-   **Dynamic Product Catalog:** Products are fetched from a back-end API.
-   **Separation of Concerns:** Clearly separated client-side (React) and server-side (Node.js) codebases.
-   **REST API:** A simple RESTful API built with Express to serve product data.

## Technologies Used

-   **Front-end:** React.js
-   **Back-end:** Node.js, Express
-   **Communication:** REST API, CORS
